# **Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data**
## 💵Background	
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance[^1]. 
## 📊Chart working with web-based visualization tools and data 
Here is the chart about General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio on 2020:

### Analysis and Thinking
<details open>
<summary>👀 My Analysis </summary>

+ We can get data about General government debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2021 on the OECD official website, but since the value of OECD-average reaches its maximum in 2020, in this chart we only use data in 2020. 
+ The chart clearly compares the rates of the different countries in 2020 and sorts them according to the rates, making it easy for the viewer to complete the comparison.
+ the chart highlights the OECD-average figures, making it easy for viewers to see which countries are above or below the average.
+ The chart only contains specific values for each country in 2020, which is enough information if that's the topic the audience wants to focus on. But I would prefer to see how it changes from year to year, after all, just one year of data is too one-sided to evaluate the performance of each country.

<summary>❓ My Thoughts on Visualization Design</summary>
+ This is the chart working with web-based visualization tools and data,  so the design comes from the web page.
+ I made the chart appear on the viewer's screen at a more appropriate size by adjusting the width and height of the chart.

<summary>❓ My Thoughts on Visualization Design</summary>

+ In this chart, I want the viewer to quickly know by the title what topic the chart will discuss. 
+ I think the explanatory notes below the title will further help the viewer to identify what the chart represents.
+ I think the charts allow the viewer to quickly compare trends across countries, debt-to-GDP ratio for different countries in the same year and debt-to-GDP ratio for the same country in different years.
+ Because the grid of line chart includes many line charts, I use a uniform color to make the chart less cluttered.
