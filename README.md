# About me
👩‍🎓 I'm Yuxuan Li from [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu) [MISM](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/) global program. I'm very interested in data visualization and creative design, so I really expect to take TSWD course. 

🎓 When I study at school, I look like this:

👀 However, after school, sometimes I'm like this:

This is because I'm professional in ❤️ Chinese Traditional Dance. So I take at least 5 hours to choreograph and practice dancing every day. But I will also try my best to complete 💙 Assignments for this course! I hope we can all make excellent portfolios.
