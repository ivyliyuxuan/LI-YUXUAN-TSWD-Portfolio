# LI YUXUAN-TSWD-Portfolio
:blush: Hello, nice to meet you! Welcome to my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! Here's where my cool work will go.

This is because I'm professional in :heartpulse: Chinese Traditional Dance. So I take at least 5 hours to choreograph and practice dancing every day. But I will also try my best to complete :blue_heart: Assignments for this course! I hope we can all make excellent portfolios.

:two: Improve data analysis capability

:three: Duild valuable design skills

:four: Have an opportunity to learn Tableau

:five: Tell the story the data supports
