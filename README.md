# About me
👩‍🎓 I'm Yuxuan Li from [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu) [MISM](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/) global program. I'm very interested in data visualization and creative design, so I really expect to take TSWD course. 

🎓 When I study at school, I look like this:

👀 However, after school, sometimes I'm like this:

This is because I'm professional in ❤️ Chinese Traditional Dance. So I take at least 5 hours to choreograph and practice dancing every day. But I will also try my best to complete 💙 Assignments for this course! I hope we can all make excellent portfolios.

# What I hope to learn
1️⃣ Create better data visualizations supported by narrative

2️⃣ Improve data analysis capability

3️⃣ Duild valuable design skills

4️⃣ Have an opportunity to learn Tableau

5️⃣ Tell the story the data supports
