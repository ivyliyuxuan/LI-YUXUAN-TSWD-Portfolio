# LI YUXUAN-TSWD-Portfolio
😊 Hello, nice to meet you! Welcome to my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! Here's where my cool work will go. 

# About me
I'm Yuxuan Li from MISM global program. I'm very interested in data visualization and creative design, so I really expect to take TSWD course. 

👩‍🎓 Maybe you saw me like this in school:

👀 However, after school, I mainly work as follows:

This is because I'm professional in ❤️ Chinese Traditional Dance. So I take at least 5 hours to choreograph and practice dancing every day. But I will also try my best to complete 💙 Assignments for this course! I hope we can all make excellent portfolios.
