## The data visualization selected
After reading and perusing numerous articles, news and reports, I chose the [first chart](https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/greatspeculations/files/2014/05/graph-1.jpg?format=jpg&width=960) of [Growth Versus Value With Markets At A Crossroads](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/05/06/growth-versus-value-with-markets-at-a-crossroads/?sh=250923893e96) (It's a pity that I cannot find the title of this chart, which is also one of problems of this visualizationüò•). 

The following graph shows the year to year swings of various asset classes along with the 20 year long term average of each asset class (on the right).  The long term averages reveal the range of the investment returns, along with the average of that range.  Where the market lies within the range has a very dramatic impact on the experience you have as an investor[1^].
