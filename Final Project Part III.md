# Brief Summary So Far üíïüí™üòò
## Summary for Part I ‚úçÔ∏è
In Part I, because I hope to look at the working overtime situation in the U.S. through this project, I pick the topic about **how to solve the dilemma of working overtime in the U.S.**.  <br>
 <br> 
After determing the topic, I planned the  whole story is divided into **7 big scenarios** of smaller story points: <br> 
**Scenario 1:** Introduce the working hours in the countries of the world and compare with each other. <br> 
**Scenario 2:** Focus on the average working hours in the United States. <br> 
**Scenario 3:** Pay attention to the US paid time off situation and holiday usage data. <br> 
**Scenario 4:** Concern about the hazards of overtime work. <br> 
**Scenario 5:** Explore why employees work overtime even though there are so many hazards. <br> 
**Scenario 6:** Study what kind of people are more courageous to refuse to work overtime. <br> 
**Scenario 7:** Call to reject meaningless working overtime. <br> 
 <br> 
And then I developed a pitch for my  presentation that included **Project Summary**, **Project Topic**, **Reader Perspective**, **Call To Action**, **The Story Arc**, and also **Data Source**. Plus, I also completed **the draft of charts** using in presentation. The chart of final project was designed and created with Tebleau, Inforgram, Flourish and Canva. <br>
 <br>    
Additionally, I also identified how I will tell this story. The final deliverables will be an interactive stand-alone project created with **Shorthand**. Each of the scenarios depicted above will have one or two pages on the final Shorthand website. Interaction and movement between pages will be used to promote interactivity and engagement with potential audiences. Moreover, key information will be highlighted through the use of color. <br>
 <br>

## Summary for Part II üìä
In Part II, after the discussion with my classmates, I redivided the whole story into **5 big scenarios** with some small stories: <br> 
**Scenario 1:** Setup - Look into the status of overtime in the United States <br> 
&emsp; **Story 1.1:** Introduce the working hours in the countries of the world and compare with each other. <br> 
&emsp; **Story 1.2:** (small conflict) Focus on the average working hours in the United States. <br> 
**Scenario 2:** Pay attention to the US paid time off situation and holiday usage data. <br> 
**Scenario 3:** Conflict- Concern about the hazards of overtime work. <br> 
**Scenario 4:** In-depth exploration - Explore why employees work overtime even though there are so many hazards. <br> 
**Scenario 5:** Resolution - How to refuse to work overtime <br> 
&emsp; **Story 5.1:** Study what kind of people are more courageous to refuse to work overtime. <br>
&emsp; **Story 5.2:** How to become a person who can refuse to work overtime <br> 
**Scenario 6:** Call on - Call to reject meaningless working overtime. <br> 
 <br>

Besides, I started to construct the actual narrative that will take the reader on the journey through my story. After the suggestions from classmates of my draft charts in the part I, I **redesigned the Wireframes and storyboards using Shorthand**, and also completed the **moodboard**. After that, I also identified the **Target Audience**, found representative individuals to **interview**, and collected the **feedback** from them to improve your story. <br>
 <br>


## Summary for Part III üéØ
In Part III, I'm moving on to **final deliverable** which will be completed and giving the published story on Shorthand. I'm **redesigning the shorthand websites and charts** based on all previous feedbacks. I'm also providing a **writeup on Github** that summarizes my work done for the final presentation. Finally, I will implement everything into the shorthand website, and will give a **presentation** during the last class of Telling Stories With Data course in CMU. 
 


# Change in the Final Data Story üé¨
Changes made since completion of part II:
## Add menu bar
On the top of the website, I add a menu bar with the titles of each major section. This bar gives the audience a clearer idea of the structure and allows readers to effortlessly go back and forth between sections. <br>
![Add menu bar.png](./Add menu bar.png)
 <br>
## Add the section covers
I add the section cover before each scenarios to give the audience a clearer idea of the topic of each scenarios. <br>
![Add the section covers 1.png](./Add the section covers 1.png)
 <br>
![Add the section covers 2.png](./Add the section covers 2.png)
 <br>
![Add the section covers 3.png](./Add the section covers 3.png)
 <br>
![Add the section covers 4.png](./Add the section covers 4.png)
 <br>
![Add the section covers 5.png](./Add the section covers 5.png)
 <br>
![Add the section covers 6.png](./Add the section covers 6.png)
 <br>
## Change the formate of data in chart
Based on the suggestions from classmates, I change the data formate from 0.49 to 49% and from 0.21 to 21% in the chart, because it will be consistent with the description below the chart. <br>
![Change data format 1.png](./Change data format 1.png)
 <br>
![Change data format 2.png](./Change data format 2.png)
 <br>

## Add informatiion about working while on vacation
Based on the suggestion from classmates, they hope me to put more information about that people are still working while on vacation. They think this information made them more disappointed. Therefore, I add informatiion about working while on vacation.

 <br>
 
## Redesign the exploration of why employees work overtime even though there are so many hazards.
 <br>



## Redesign the content of how to refuse to work overtime
 <br>            
 <br>
 
## Redesign the content of how to become a person who can refuse to work overtime

 <br> 
 <br>
 
## Redesign the content of call to reject meaningless working overtime.


 <br> 
 
 

# Target audience üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
The main target audience are employees or prospective employees who are suffering or at risk of suffering from overtime. <br>
Because the call to action of this whole project is to ask for workers to stand up to refuse and defend their right when overtime is so serious that it has infringed on their right, employees or prospective employees who are suffering or at risk of suffering from overtime will be more likely to relate to the content. <br>


 <br>
 <br>
 
# Suggestions from classmates üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì
1Ô∏è‚É£ Call to use more paid time off in the call to the last Call on part. <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Edit the chart about total paid vacation and paid holidays of each OECD nations, letting it give more focus on 0 by larger size. And only pick top 5 coutries to compare with the U.S.
 
# Main Findings & Possible changes
## For Logic and content
1Ô∏è‚É£ Add more information on how to solve or avoid the overtime problem, as this is the part that the audience cares most about. <br>
## For design 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Add a tab directory or other cue to give the audience a clearer idea of the structure. <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Give a well design of the cover. <br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Redesign the last call on part. Maybe I can use some dynamic charts etc. to increase the visual experience of the audience. <br>
## For charts
1Ô∏è‚É£ Redesign the chart which presents that manufacturing, finance and information industries are more likely to have paid leave benefits. It may be possible to place these three industries in the main view area of the audience, in the upper left corner, and give a relatively large area. And the other industries in a smaller area in the lower right corner. <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Redesign the chart which presents the longer service requirement brings longer vacation. It might be possible to make the chart less cluttered by adding control to allow viewers to choose between private industry or the state and local government. <br>
