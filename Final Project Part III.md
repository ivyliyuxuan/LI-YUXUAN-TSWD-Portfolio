# Brief Summary So Far üíïüí™üòò
## Summary for Part I ‚úçÔ∏è
In Part I, because I hope to look at the working overtime situation in the U.S. through this project, I pick the topic about **how to solve the dilemma of working overtime in the U.S.**.  <br>
 <br> 
After determing the topic, I planned the  whole story is divided into **7 big scenarios** of smaller story points: <br> 
**Scenario 1:** Introduce the working hours in the countries of the world and compare with each other. <br> 
**Scenario 2:** Focus on the average working hours in the United States. <br> 
**Scenario 3:** Pay attention to the US paid time off situation and holiday usage data. <br> 
**Scenario 4:** Concern about the hazards of overtime work. <br> 
**Scenario 5:** Explore why employees work overtime even though there are so many hazards. <br> 
**Scenario 6:** Study what kind of people are more courageous to refuse to work overtime. <br> 
**Scenario 7:** Call to reject meaningless working overtime. <br> 
 <br> 
And then I developed a pitch for my  presentation that included **Project Summary**, **Project Topic**, **Reader Perspective**, **Call To Action**, **The Story Arc**, and also **Data Source**. Plus, I also completed **the draft of charts** using in presentation. The chart of final project was designed and created with Tebleau, Inforgram, Flourish and Canva. <br>
 <br>
Additionally, I also identified how I will tell this story. The final deliverables will be an interactive stand-alone project created with **Shorthand**. Each of the scenarios depicted above will have one or two pages on the final Shorthand website. Interaction and movement between pages will be used to promote interactivity and engagement with potential audiences. Moreover, key information will be highlighted through the use of color. <br>
 <br>

## Summary for Part II üìä
In Part II, after the discussion with my classmates, I redivided the whole story into **5 big scenarios** with some small stories: <br>
**Scenario 1:** Setup - Look into the status of overtime in the United States <br> 
&emsp; **Story 1.1:** Introduce the working hours in the countries of the world and compare with each other. <br> 
&emsp; **Story 1.2:** (small conflict) Focus on the average working hours in the United States. <br> 
**Scenario 2:** Pay attention to the US paid time off situation and holiday usage data. <br> 
**Scenario 3:** Conflict- Concern about the hazards of overtime work. <br> 
**Scenario 4:** In-depth exploration - Explore why employees work overtime even though there are so many hazards. <br> 
**Scenario 5:** Resolution - How to refuse to work overtime <br> 
&emsp; **Story 5.1:** Study what kind of people are more courageous to refuse to work overtime. <br>
&emsp; **Story 5.2:** How to become a person who can refuse to work overtime <br> 
**Scenario 6:** Call on - Call to reject meaningless working overtime. <br> 
 <br>
Besides, I started to construct the actual narrative that will take the reader on the journey through my story. After the suggestions from classmates of my draft charts in the part I, I **redesigned the Wireframes and storyboards using Shorthand**, and also completed the **moodboard**. After that, I also identified the **Target Audience**, found representative individuals to **interview**, and collected the **feedback** from them to improve your story. <br>
 <br>


## Summary for Part III üéØ
In Part III, I'm moving on to **final deliverable** which will be completed and giving the published story on Shorthand. I'm **redesigning the shorthand websites and charts** based on all previous feedbacks. I'm also providing a **writeup on Github** that summarizes my work done for the final presentation. Finally, I will implement everything into the shorthand website, and will give a **presentation** during the last class of Telling Stories With Data course in CMU. <br>
Importantly, because this is a public website, I edit the formate of the **cite** of external sources more normative.
 <br> 
 
# Change in the Final Data Story üé¨
Changes made since completion of part II: <br>

## Add menu bar
As the suggestions from classmates, on the top of the website, I add a menu bar with the titles of each major section. This bar gives the audience a clearer idea of the structure and allows readers to effortlessly go back and forth between sections. <br>
![Add menu bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221988156-7c4fcebf-644d-4261-bb31-8c075520da80.png)

 <br>

As the requirement of course, I edit the formate of the cite of external sources more normative. <br>

 <br>

## Add the cultural differences
Based on the suggestion from professor, for comparisons between the US and China / India, I add worth explaining why some cultural differences might exist to give more valuable information for students. <br>
 <br>
![cultural difference](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221988393-6acacf6f-21ef-454f-8187-9af7e8b68f62.JPG)
 <br>
 
## Change the formate of data in chart
Based on the suggestions from classmates, I change the data formate from 0.49 to 49% and from 0.21 to 21% in the chart, because it will be consistent with the description below the chart. <br>
![Change data format 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221988443-53a9b0f5-21ca-40cc-ade3-64c534d6fb9c.png)

 <br>

## Add informatiion about working while on vacation
Based on the suggestion from classmates, they hope me to put more information about that people are still working while on vacation. They think this information made them more disappointed. Therefore, I add informatiion about working while on vacation. <br>
![Add informatiion about working while on vacation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221993904-27e82c57-7f23-4c90-8bad-5754c08a695e.png)
 <br>
 
## Redesign why employees work overtime even though there are so many hazards.
Based on the suggestion from classmates, the original chart to present the survey result about why employees still working overtime is dizzy. Therefore, I redesign it and use more words to illustrute the results. <br>
![survey 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221994143-e9eac76f-6c6a-4ada-b4fe-000a3fcd0b0f.png)

 <br>
 
## Redesign the content of how to refuse to work overtime
Based on the suggestion from classmates, I make the important information bold and use red or green color to attract the eyes of audiences. Plus, I also give some examples of dialogue to help the audiences to learn about how to refuse work overtime.<br>
![refuse 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221994844-d1e6c9bd-20a1-4be9-8151-d2785d58a4ef.png)

 <br>     
 
## Redesign the Top 3 Industries
Based on the suggestion from classmates, I eedesign the Top 3 Industries with the highest percentage of employees taking paid vacation. I just pick top three industries and delete other information to make it clear. <br> 
![Top 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221995010-d74c5469-c97d-450d-b02e-3a2f73b28307.png)
 <br>    

 
## Redesign the content of call to reject meaningless working overtime.
Based on the suggestion from classmates, I'm supposed to give more words to engage audience about refusing overtime work. So I use both charts and the illustration for the the last call on section.
![Call on 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221988552-443eef72-004c-4acd-bef6-221f0ed5e15b.png)

 <br>   

## Add thanks part in the end of the website
I add the "Thank You" in the last page of the website.
![Thank You](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107164906/221988507-c34c8cf6-9840-4939-83c5-42ae7c828183.png)
 <br> 


# Target audience üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
The main target audience are employees or prospective employees who are suffering or at risk of suffering from overtime. <br>
Because the call to action of this whole project is to ask for workers to stand up to refuse and defend their right when overtime is so serious that it has infringed on their right, employees or prospective employees who are suffering or at risk of suffering from overtime will be more likely to relate to the content. <br>
More specifically, my target audience is Carnegie Mellon University recent graduates who don't know much about the current overtime situation in the U.S. or how to turn it down in the workplace. I hope to use this website to help them understand what they should know about Overtime work in the U.S. but don't. <br>
